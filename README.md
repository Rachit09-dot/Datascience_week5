# MySQL Assignment — Tables, Logical Operators, Aggregate Functions & ORDER BY

This assignment demonstrates the use of **MySQL queries** including:

- Table creation  
- Data insertion  
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)  
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)  
- GROUP BY  
- ORDER BY  
- Basic JOIN query  

All queries were executed using an **online MySQL compiler**.
